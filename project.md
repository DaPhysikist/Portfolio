## Week Zero: Project Inception

This week I came up with the idea for my project after thinking back on an idea I had in the past about traffic collisions. I wanted to use embedded concepts such as wireless communication, RTOS and board/peripheral bring up to familiriaze myself with the skills I need to become an embedded engineer. I also wanted to apply my interest in light and communication-based physics. After some hours thinking and researching existing ideas, I decided what I wanted to do, hoping that my idea was unique.

## Week One: Further Research and Initial Material Procurement

This week I began researching additional concepts my project might use, and I came across C-V2X, a standard that is becoming big nowadays for cars (especially autonomous cars) for talking with other cars and infrastructure. This page by Qualcomm (based right here in San Diego!) was quite interesting:
